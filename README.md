I regularly have icons not show up on my dual screen Linux Mint Mate setup.  With the help of Chatgpt I produced this helper program that when run shows
the layout of my 2 screens and where the icons are positionned.  If an icon is outside the visible screen area I can now drag it back to the visible area.

Misplaced icons sometimes happens when I create a new icon or when I play around with the resolution and positionning of the screens.

The program is python and it uses the tkinter module for the graphic user inteface (GUI).
